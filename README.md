# Jobly

This was a project that really tested my fullstack knowledge. It allows the user to log in, register and apply to jobs. Admins may create, edit and delete jobs. All applied jobs are saved in a PostgreSQL database. Try it out [here](https://jobly-project-frontend.herokuapp.com/)

### Tools
This app used Express, Node, React and Reactstrap/Bootstrap
